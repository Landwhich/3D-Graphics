<h2>Summary of Task:</h2>
<p>
    The goal of assignment 1 is to write a maya script in python to 
    find the insection point between a circle center and each of its vectors on a 
    cube
</p>

<h2>Methods Used:</h2>
<p>
    I found the course notes and tutorial sessions to be incredibly 
    helpful for this assignment. I have included my notes to show my 
    process but this generally follows the discuss ideas in class.
    <br>
    I took the following steps:
    <ol>
        <li>find circle midpoint using maya selection and xform</li>
        <li>get all vertices and faces, subdivide target faces into triangles to get the facet normals</li>
        <li>find the planar intersection and make sure it falls within the triangle</li>
    </ol>
    I later realized it wouldn't be so simple as I would have to check this for every target "sub-triangle" to find the 
    shortest distance

    as well as tutorial notes for information on maya's object notation
